# Quantum-Monte-Carlo-Methods
An attempt to explore the application of QMC methods in calculating the ground state properties of quantum systems; specifically focusing on implementing the VMC and DMC algorithms to study the behaviour of simple quantum systems, such as one-dimensional potential wells or interacting many-particle systems.
# Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) Project

This project explores the application of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, specifically Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), to accurately calculate the ground state properties of quantum systems.

## Introduction

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful techniques used to study quantum systems, providing a way to approximate the behavior of particles in complex quantum systems. In this project, we implement VMC and DMC algorithms to analyze multi-quantum systems and investigate their time-dependent behavior.

## Features

- Variational Monte Carlo (VMC): This module performs wave function evaluation, random walk, and parameter optimization to analyze multi-quantum systems. It allows us to approximate the ground state energy and wave function of the system.
- Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC): This module extends the analysis to include DMC, which investigates the time-dependent behavior of quantum systems. It includes branching algorithms and stochastic time-step propagation for comprehensive insight.
